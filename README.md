                                                 Pymaceuticals Inc. Analysis

Analyisis of an  animal study of 249 mice that were identified with SCC tumors and received treatment with a range of drug regimens. Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticals’ drug of interest, Capomulin, against the other treatment regimens.

                                                 Insights and observations 

•    The regression analysis shows how much the average tumor volume will change when weight of the mouse changes. Average tumor volume (y) = 0.95 Weight (x) + 21.55 inidicating a positive slope of the regression line. Based on our final model, we have a strong positive correlation which can be interpreted as a one-unit increase in weight, will lead to a 22.50 increase in the average tumor.

•   The bar graph shows that the drug regimen Capomulin was tested on the highest number of mice (230), followed by Ramicane (228).

•	The male and female mice population was very close i.e. 50.6% male, and 49.4% female mice in the study. This shows a balanced gender population.

•	From the statistics table and box plot, we can conclude that Capomulin and Ramicane treatments were more effective than the other drugs.

•	The correlation between mouse weight and average tumor volume is 0.84 indicating a fairly strong positive relationship between the weight and tumor
